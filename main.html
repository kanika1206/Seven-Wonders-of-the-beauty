<h1><b><u>THE 7 WONDERS OF THE WORLD</u></b></h1>
<h2><b><u>TAJ MAHAL</u></b></h2>
<div>
<pre><strong><i>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra,
Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan  (r. 1628–1658)
to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself.
The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house,
and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Islamic art
in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded as one of
the best examples of Mughal architecture and a symbol of Indian history. The Taj Mahal is a major tourist
attraction and attracts more than five million visitors a year. In 2007, it was declared a winner of the
New 7 Wonders of the World initiative.</i></strong>

<h2><b><u>THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA</u></b></h2>
<div>
<pre><strong><i>The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical
northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups
from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC, with selective
stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall
remains. Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls.
The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty(1368–1644).

The frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple courses. Collectively, they stretch from Liaodong
in the east to Lop Lake in the west, from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao River (Taohe)
in the south; along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe; spanning 21,196.18 km
in total. Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is generally recognized as one of the most
impressive architectural feats in history.

<h2><b><u>PETRA</u></b></h2>
<div>
<pre><strong><i>Petra, originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu or Raqēmō, is a historic and archaeological
city in southern Jordan. Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system, Petra is also called
the "Rose City" because of the colour of the sandstone from which it is carved; it was called "a rose-red city
half as old as time" in a poem of 1845 by John Burgon. It is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a
basin surrounded by mountains forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead Sea to the
Gulf of Aqaba. Access to the city is through a picturesque 1.2-kilometre-long gorge called the Siq, which leads
directly to the Khazneh.

It has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985. UNESCO has described Petra as "one of the most precious
cultural properties of man's cultural heritage". In 2007, Petra was voted one of the New 7 Wonders of the
World. Petra is a symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction.

<h2><b><u>COLOSSEUM</u></b></h2>
<div>
<pre><strong><i>The Colosseum is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east
of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing
amphitheatre in the world, despite its age. Construction began under the Emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) in
72 and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81). Further modifications were made
during the reign of Domitian (r. 81–96). The three emperors who were patrons of the work are known as 
the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre.

Although substantially ruined by earthquakes and stone robbers taking spolia, the Colosseum is still a renowned
symbol of Imperial Rome and was listed as one of the New 7 Wonders of the World. It is one of Rome's most 
popular tourist attractions and has links to the Catholic Church, as each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit
"Way of the Cross" procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum. The Colosseum is depicted on the
Italian version of the 5 euro cent coin.

<h2><b><u>CHRIST THE REDEEMER</u></b></h2>
<div>
<pre><strong><i>Christ the Redeemer is an Art Deco statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by
French-Polish sculptor Paul Landowski and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration 
French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida sculpted the face. Constructed between 1922
and 1931, the statue is 30 metres (98 ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The arms stretch 28
metres (92 ft) wide. It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone. Christ The Redeemer differs considerably
from its original design, as the initial plan was a large Christ with a globe in one hand and a cross in the
other.

The statue weighs 635 metric tons, and is located at the peak of the 700-metre Corcovado mountain in the 
Tijuca National Park overlooking the city of Rio de Janeiro. This statue is the largest Art Deco-style 
sculpture in the world. A symbol of Christianity around the world, the statue has also become a cultural
icon of both Rio de Janeiro and Brazil and was voted one of the New 7 Wonders of the world.

<h2><b><u>GIZA PYRAMIDS</u></b></h2>
<div>
<pre><strong><i>The Giza pyramid complex (also called the Giza necropolis) in Egypt is home to the Great
Pyramid, the Pyramid of Khafre, and the Pyramid of Menkaure, along with their associated pyramid complexes
and the Great Sphinx. All were built during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of ancient Egypt, between
c.2600 – c.2500 BC. The site also includes several temples, cemeteries, and the remains of a workers' village.

The Great Pyramid and the Pyramid of Khafre are the largest pyramids built in ancient Egypt, and they have
historically been common as emblems of Ancient Egypt in the Western imagination. They were popularised in
Hellenistic times, when the Great Pyramid was listed by Antipater of Sidon as one of the Seven Wonders of
the World. It is by far the oldest of the Ancient Wonders and the only one still in existence.

</div>
<h2><b><u>MACHU PICCHU</u></b></h2>
<div>
<pre><strong><i>Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru
on a 2,430-meter mountain ridge. Often referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas", it is the most familiar
Valley, which is 80 kilometers northwest of Cusco. The Urubamba River flows past it, cutting through the
Cordillera and creating a canyon with a tropical mountain climate. In reference to the site's name, for most
English or Spanish speakers, the first 'c' in Picchu is silent.

Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historic Sanctuary in 1982 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.
In 2007, Machu Picchu was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in a worldwide internet poll.
